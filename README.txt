Welcome to my Sudoku Game! In this game you are able to play Sudoku at 5 levels of difficulty. A help screen is included with further instructions. You can turn on legals mode to check what values are possible. Additionally there are two hints a player can ask for. The first hint directs a player to a cell with only 1 legal value in it. The second hint directs the player to eliminate certain legal values form certain cells, based on the legal values in cells within the same region.

To run the game, simply run the file "sudoku2.py". You will need the cmu_graphics package, and the folder containing all the hardcoded starting boards.
